# X-Ray Imaging 

## Topic
Use a convolutional neural network to determine if a chest x-ray shows signs of COVID, pneumonia, or are healthy lungs.

## Data
https://www.kaggle.com/alexkort/xray-covid19

## Process
Ideally, I would like to use this data to train a model, then use some x-ray images obtained from the local hospital here to predict on and see how the model does on a real world scenario.
